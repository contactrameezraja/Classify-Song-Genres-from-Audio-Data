# Classify-Song-Genres-from-Audio-Data

In the Classify Song Genres machine learning project, you will be using the song dataset to classify songs into two categories: 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock.' You will check the correlation between features, normalize data using scikit-learnâ€™s StandardScaler, apply PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on scaled data, and visualize the results. 

After that, you will use the scikit-learn Logistic Regression and Decision Tree model to train and validate the results. In this project, you will also learn some of the advanced techniques such as class balancing and cross-validation to reduce model bias and overfitting. 

Decision Tree:
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

    Hip-Hop       0.66      0.66      0.66       229
      Rock       0.92      0.92      0.92       972

avg / total       0.87      0.87      0.87      1201

Logistic Regression:
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

    Hip-Hop       0.75      0.57      0.65       229
      Rock       0.90      0.95      0.93       972

avg / total       0.87      0.88      0.87      1201

Classifying Song Genres from Audio Data is a guided project. You can replicate the result on a different dataset, such as the Hotel Booking Demand one. You can use it to predict whether a customer will cancel the booking or not.
